# Picking up issues

To start on a feature or bugfix, head to its [issue page](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/articles-bot/issues) (if it's not there, [create it](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/articles-bot/issues/new/choose) and link to any relevant [discussions](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/articles-bot/discussions)) and assign yourself using the "Assignees" dropdown.

A new branch will automatically be created [here](https://github.com/solutions-podcast/articles-bot/branches), which you can then checkout on your local machine by running `git fetch` and then `git checkout <branch name>`.

Branches that have not been worked on for over 4 months will be reassigned to someone else, in order to keep development active.

# Local development setup

TBD

# Understanding the code

(here we can write out where commands are stored, how the database and other infrastructure works, etc)
